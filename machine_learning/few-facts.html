            <h3>âœ… Why is Cross-Validation Needed?</h3>
            <p>In any machine learning model, if the model performs poorly on the test data, we typically adjust the
                hyperparameters or switch to a different model. If we repeat this process multiple times, there is a
                chance that we might achieve good accuracy on the test data without overfitting. However, despite this,
                the model might still perform poorly on unseen data. The reason for this is that we measured the
                generalization error multiple times on the test set, causing the model and its hyperparameters to adapt
                specifically to that set. As a result, the model becomes overly optimized for the test set and is
                unlikely to perform well on new, unseen data.</p>

                <h3>What is k-fold cross validation?</h3>
                <p>
                    By reducing the training data, we risk losing important patterns/trends in the data set, which in
                    turn increases
                    error induced by bias. With k-fold CV, we will have enough data for training & validation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After splitting the total data set (D<sub>n</sub>) into training (D<sub>Train</sub>) and test
                    (D<sub>Test</sub>) data
                    sets in the ratio of 80:20, we further randomly split the training data into k equal parts. E.g.:
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have to randomly split the data set into k equal parts, then compute k different accuracies for
                    each
                    hyperparameter value and take their mean. Time complexity for k folds will be k * n * d, making it
                    O(knd), where k is the number of folds.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Generally, k = 5, 10 is preferred.</strong></p>

            <h3>Example of 5-Fold Cross Validation:</h3>
            <p>
                In a **5-Fold Cross Validation**, the training data is split into **5 equal parts**. In each iteration:
            <ul>
                <li>One part is used for testing (shown in yellow).</li>
                <li>The remaining four parts are used for training (shown in blue).</li>
            </ul>
            This process is repeated **5 times**, with each fold being the test set once.
            </p>

            <h3>Formula for Final Performance Score:</h3>
            <p>
                The final performance is calculated as the **mean of the individual performances** across all k
                iterations:
                <br>
                <strong>Performance = (1/k) * Î£ Performance<sub>i</sub> for i=1 to k</strong>
            </p>

            <h3>Time Complexity of K-Fold Cross Validation</h3>
            <p>
                We must compute k different accuracies for each hyperparameter value and take their mean.
                The time complexity for k folds is **O(k * n * d)**, where:
            <ul>
                <li>k = number of folds</li>
                <li>n = number of data points</li>
                <li>d = model complexity</li>
            </ul>
            Generally, **k = 5 or 10** is preferred.

            <h3>What is KD-Tree?</h3>
            <p>A <b>K-Dimensional Tree (KD-Tree)</b> is a binary tree used for organizing points in
                k-dimensional space. It is mainly used for nearest neighbor search,
                range queries, and spatial indexing.
            </p>

            <h3>Example: Constructing a KD-Tree</h3>
            <p>Let's consider a set of 2D points: <b>(7,2), (5,4), (9,6), (2,3), (4,7), (8,1)</b>.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Step 1:</b> Choose the first axis (x-axis) and sort points by x-coordinate.</li>
                <li><b>Step 2:</b> Select the median point as the root. Here, (7,2) is the root.</li>
                <li><b>Step 3:</b> Recursively split the remaining points using alternating axes (x â†’ y
                    â†’ x...).</li>
            </ol>


            <h3>Time Complexity of KD-Tree</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Build Time Complexity:</b> O(n log n)</li>
                <li><b>Nearest Neighbor Search (Best Case):</b> O(log n)</li>
                <li><b>Nearest Neighbor Search (Worst Case):</b> O(n) (if the tree is unbalanced)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How KD-Tree Helps in KNN?</h3>
            <p>
                When searching for the nearest neighbors of a query point, the KD-Tree:
            <ul>
                <li>Prunes irrelevant branches of the tree.</li>
                <li>Reduces the number of distance calculations.</li>
                <li>Significantly speeds up search compared to brute-force O(n) search.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Image Recognition (e.g., finding similar images)</li>
                <li>Geospatial Search (e.g., finding nearby locations on a map)</li>
                <li>Machine Learning (e.g., used in KNN for fast classification)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The diagram above illustrates how a KD-Tree partitions the space step by step. Each
                split divides the space based on an alternating axis (x, then y, then x again, etc.).

            <h2>What is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)?</h2>
            <p>
                Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a technique used for approximate nearest neighbor search in
                high-dimensional spaces.
                Unlike traditional hashing methods, LSH increases the probability that similar data points will be
                mapped to
                the same hash bucket.
                This makes LSH useful in applications such as document similarity, image retrieval, and recommendation
                systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Example of LSH:</h3>
            <p>Suppose we have the following three text documents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Doc 1:</b> "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"</li>
                <li><b>Doc 2:</b> "The fast brown fox leaps over the sleepy dog"</li>
                <li><b>Doc 3:</b> "A red apple is on the table"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Using LSH with a MinHash function for text similarity, Doc 1 and Doc 2 would likely hash to the same
                bucket
                because
                they contain similar words. However, Doc 3 is quite different and would hash to a different bucket.
            </p>

            <h3>How It Works:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Convert documents into sets of words (or shingles).</li>
                <li>Compute MinHash signatures for each document.</li>
                <li>Use multiple hash functions to group similar documents into the same bucket.</li>
                <li>Retrieve similar documents by checking within the same bucket.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Benefits of LSH:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficient for high-dimensional data</li>
                <li>Speeds up nearest neighbor searches</li>
                <li>Used in search engines, plagiarism detection, and machine learning applications</li>

            <h2>What is the Curse of Dimensionality?</h2>
            <p>
                The Curse of Dimensionality refers to the various problems that arise when working with high-dimensional
                data.
                As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space grows exponentially, leading to sparsity
                and
                increased computational complexity.
                This phenomenon can cause issues such as overfitting, increased distance between data points, and the
                need
                for more data to maintain statistical significance.
            </p>

            <h3>Effects of the Curse of Dimensionality:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased computational complexity</li>
                <li>Sparsity of data points</li>
                <li>Increased distance between data points</li>
                <li>Overfitting due to the abundance of features</li>
                <li>Need for more data to maintain statistical significance</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategies to Mitigate the Curse of Dimensionality:</h3>
            <ul>

                <h3>Reachability Distance:</h3>
                <p>
                    Reachability distance expresses the maximum of the distance between two points and the k-distance of the second point.
                    The distance metric used can be Euclidean, Minkowski, Manhattan, or any other distance measure.
                </p>
                <p><b>Formula:</b></p>
                <p><code>Reachability_Distance(a, b) = max{ k-distance(b), normal_distance(a, b) }</code></p>
            
                <h3>Local Reachability Density:</h3>
                <p>
                    Local reachability density refers to how far we need to go from a given point to reach its neighboring points.
                    The reachability distances of the k closest neighbors of a point are used to calculate the local reachability density.
                    The sum of these reachability distances is divided by k, and the inverse of this value gives the desired density.
                </p>
                <p><b>Formula:</b></p>
                <p><code>Local_reachability_density(a) = 1 / ( sum( Reachability_Distance(a, n) ) / k )</code></p>
                <p>Where <b>n</b> refers to the k nearest neighbors of point <b>a</b>.</p>

                    <h2>Local Outlier Factor (LOF)</h2>
                
                    <p>
                        The <b>Local Outlier Factor (LOF)</b> is a measure used to identify the degree to which a data point deviates from its neighbors.
                        It is based on the concept of local density and is particularly useful for detecting outliers in datasets with varying densities.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>How LOF Works:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>LOF compares the local reachability density of a point with those of its k-nearest neighbors.</li>
                        <li>If a point has a significantly lower local reachability density than its neighbors, it is considered an outlier.</li>
                        <li>LOF values greater than 1 indicate outliers, where higher values signify stronger anomalies.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h3>Formula:</h3>
                    <p>
                        <code>LOF(a) = ( sum( Local_reachability_density(n) / Local_reachability_density(a) ) ) / k</code>
                    </p>
                    <p>Where <b>n</b> refers to the k-nearest neighbors of point <b>a</b>.</p>
                
                    <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>LOF â‰ˆ 1 â†’ The point is in a dense region (normal).</li>
                        <li>LOF > 1 â†’ The point is in a sparse region (potential outlier).</li>
                        <li>Higher LOF â†’ Stronger outlier indication.</li>
