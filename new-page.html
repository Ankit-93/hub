    <header><h1>Statistics Interview Q&A</h1></header>
    

    <h2>1. What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of
        a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal (or Gaussian)
        distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables. It's crucial in statistics because it
        allows us to make inferences about populations using the normal distribution, which has well-understood
        properties.</p>

    <h2>2. Explain Type I and Type II errors.</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type I Error (False Positive, or Alpha error):</strong> Incorrectly rejecting a true null
            hypothesis.</li>
        <li><strong>Type II Error (False Negative, or Beta error):</strong> Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The significance level (α) is the probability of making a Type I error. The power of a test is 1 minus the
        probability of making a Type II error (β).</p>

    <h2>3. What is R-squared in linear regression?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> R-squared, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of
        the variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a regression model.
        An R-squared value of 1 indicates that the regression predictions perfectly fit the data. Values close to 1
        indicate a strong fit, while values close to 0 indicate a weak fit.</p>

    <h2>4. What is the difference between correlation and causation?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Correlation indicates a mutual relationship or association between two variables. When
        one variable changes, the other tends to change in a specific direction. However, correlation does not imply
        causation. Causation means that a change in one variable is responsible for a change in another.</p>
    <p>For example, even if there is a strong correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents, it does not
        mean that buying more ice cream causes more drownings. A lurking variable, like temperature, can be influencing
        both.</p>

    <h2>5. What is the difference between a parametric and a non-parametric test?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Parametric tests make assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution,
        such as assuming a normal distribution. Examples include t-tests and ANOVA. Non-parametric tests do not make
        strong assumptions about the population’s distribution. Examples include the Mann-Whitney U test and
        Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>

    <h2>6. Explain p-value.</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The p-value is a measure used to determine the significance of results in hypothesis
        testing. It represents the probability of observing the current data, or something more extreme, given that the
        null hypothesis is true.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its
            rejection.</li>
        <li>A larger p-value suggests weaker evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to a failure to reject it.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Describe the difference between cross-validation and bootstrapping.</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a statistical model by
        partitioning the data into a training set and a test set. A common method is k-fold cross-validation.</p>
    <p>Bootstrapping, on the other hand, is a resampling technique used to estimate the distribution of a statistic by
        sampling with replacement from the data. It helps assess variability and construct confidence intervals.</p>
    <h2>8. Can you explain the different measures of central tendency?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The three main measures of central tendency are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The average of all the numbers in a dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value in a dataset when the numbers are arranged in order.</li>
        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The number that appears most frequently in a dataset.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. What is the difference between population and sample?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A population includes all members of a specified group, while a sample is a subset of
        the population. Statistics calculated on a population are called parameters, while those calculated on a sample
        are called statistics.</p>

    <h2>10. How do you handle missing data?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Handling missing data can involve various techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Remove records with missing values.</li>
        <li><strong>Imputation:</strong> Fill missing values with estimated ones, such as using the mean, median, or
            mode of the known values, or using more complex algorithms or models to predict the missing value.</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> Use statistical techniques designed to handle missing values, such as multiple
            imputation or full information maximum likelihood estimation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. What is the interquartile range (IQR) and why is it useful?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The IQR is a measure of statistical dispersion and is calculated as the difference
        between the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) quartiles in a dataset. It is useful for understanding the spread of the
        data and for identifying outliers, as it is not affected by extremely large or small values.</p>

    <h2>12. Explain the concept of skewness in statistics.</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued
        random variable. A negative skew indicates that the left tail of the distribution is longer, while a positive
        skew indicates that the right tail is longer. A skewness of zero indicates a perfectly symmetrical distribution.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Can you describe what a box plot represents?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A box plot, or box-and-whisker plot, visually displays the distribution of a dataset,
        including its central tendency and variability. The box represents the interquartile range (IQR, Q3-Q1), the
        line inside the box shows the median, and the whiskers extend to the smallest and largest observations in the
        dataset.</p>

    <h2>14. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Variance and standard deviation are both measures of dispersion or spread in a dataset.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance. It is more commonly used because it is
            in the same units as the data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>15. What is a z-score and what is it used for?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A z-score is a statistical measurement that describes a value's relation to the mean of
        a group of values. It is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. A z-score is used to determine
        how unusual a value is, and it's commonly used for hypothesis testing, outlier detection, and comparison of
        scores from different datasets.</p>

    <h2>16. Can you explain what covariance and correlation are?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Covariance:</strong> A measure of the joint variability of two random variables. A positive
            covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase and decrease together, whereas a negative
            covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.</li>
        <li><strong>Correlation:</strong> The normalization of covariance to have values between -1 and 1, providing a
            measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables. A correlation of
            1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and
            0 indicates no linear correlation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>17. How does the presence of outliers affect the mean and median of a dataset?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Outliers can greatly affect the mean because the mean considers all values in its
        calculation. An extreme outlier can pull the mean up or down, making it less representative of the central
        location of the data. The median, however, is more resistant to outliers since it depends only on the middle
        value(s) of an ordered dataset. In datasets with outliers, the median can often be a better representation of
        central tendency.</p>

    <h2>18. Describe the concept of kurtosis. How is it different from skewness?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a probability distribution. High kurtosis
        indicates a distribution with tails heavier or more extreme than the normal distribution, and low kurtosis
        indicates a distribution with tails lighter than the normal distribution. While skewness deals with the
        asymmetry and direction of skew (left or right), kurtosis deals with the extremities (or outliers) in the
        distribution tails.</p>

    <h2>19. How do you interpret the value of a Pearson correlation coefficient?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Pearson correlation coefficient, often denoted as <em>r</em>, measures the strength
        and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Its values range between -1 and 1:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>r = 1:</strong> Perfect positive linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>r = -1:</strong> Perfect negative linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>r = 0:</strong> No linear correlation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The closer <em>r</em> is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship. However, a strong correlation does not
        imply causation.</p>

    <h2>20. Explain Simpson's Paradox and its implications in descriptive statistics.</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Simpson's Paradox occurs when a trend or relationship between two variables reverses or
        disappears when they are examined in the context of a third variable. This can happen due to confounding
        factors. It emphasizes the importance of considering all relevant factors when interpreting statistical
        relationships.</p>

    <h2>21. In a given dataset, what are the differences and relationships between the range, variance, and standard
        deviation?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The range provides a sense of the full spread of the data but is sensitive to outliers. The variance gives a
        measure of how data points differ from the mean, but it's in squared units of the data. Standard deviation,
        being the square root of variance, gives dispersion in the original units of the data and is commonly used
        because of this.</p>

    <h2>22. How would you decide between using the mean vs. median as a measure of central tendency?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The decision often depends on the shape of the data distribution and the presence of
        outliers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a symmetric distribution without outliers, the mean and median will be close, and either could be used.
        </li>
        <li>For skewed distributions or distributions with outliers, the median is usually a better representation
            because it is less affected by extreme values.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>23. Why might standard deviation be a misleading measure of spread in some situations?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Standard deviation can be misleading, especially when the data contains outliers, since
        it considers all deviations from the mean in its calculation. Extreme values can inflate the standard deviation,
        making it appear that the data is more variable than it actually is.</p>
    <h2>1. How does the presence of outliers affect the mean and median of a dataset?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Outliers can greatly affect the mean because the mean considers all values in its
        calculation. An extreme outlier can pull the mean up or down, making it less representative of the central
        location of the data. The median, however, is more resistant to outliers since it depends only on the middle
        value(s) of an ordered dataset. In datasets with outliers, the median can often be a better representation of
        central tendency.</p>

    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of a probability distribution. High kurtosis
        indicates a distribution with tails heavier or more extreme than the normal distribution, and low kurtosis
        indicates a distribution with tails lighter than the normal distribution. While skewness deals with the
        asymmetry and direction of skew (left or right), kurtosis deals with the extremities (or outliers) in the
        distribution tails.</p>

    <h2>25. How do you interpret the value of a Pearson correlation coefficient?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The Pearson correlation coefficient, often denoted as <em>r</em>, measures the strength
        and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Its values range between -1 and 1:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>r = 1:</strong> Perfect positive linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>r = -1:</strong> Perfect negative linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>r = 0:</strong> No linear correlation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The closer <em>r</em> is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship. However, a strong correlation does not
        imply causation.</p>

    <h2>26. Explain Simpson's Paradox and its implications in descriptive statistics.</h2>

        relationships.</p>

    <h2>27. In a given dataset, what are the differences and relationships between the range, variance, and standard
        deviation?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Range:</strong> The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> The square root of the variance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The range provides a sense of the full spread of the data but is sensitive to outliers. The variance gives a
        measure of how data points differ from the mean, but it's in squared units of the data. Standard deviation,
        being the square root of variance, gives dispersion in the original units of the data and is commonly used
        because of this.</p>

    <h2>28. How would you decide between using the mean vs. median as a measure of central tendency?</h2>

        outliers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For a symmetric distribution without outliers, the mean and median will be close, and either could be used.
        </li>
        <li>For skewed distributions or distributions with outliers, the median is usually a better representation

    </ul>

        making it appear that the data is more variable than it actually is.</p>

    <h2>30. Let's Try Some Use Cases on Descriptive Statistics</h2>
    <h3>Use Case: Sales Performance Analysis</h3>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A company sells products in three regions: North, South, and West. The sales team
        wants to understand the sales performance across these regions to allocate resources more efficiently.</p>
    <h4>Dataset:</h4>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th>Region</th>
            <th>Monthly Sales (in thousands)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>North</td>
            <td>12, 15, 14, 13, 17, 19, 20</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>South</td>
            <td>22, 21, 20, 23, 25, 26, 28</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>West</td>
            <td>32, 30, 31, 29, 30, 33, 35</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h4>31: Which region has the highest average monthly sales?</h4>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The mean (average) sales for each region:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>North: 15.7</li>
        <li>South: 23.6</li>
        <li>West: 31.4</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The West region has the highest average monthly sales.</p>

    <h4>32: Which region has the most consistent monthly sales (lowest variability)?</h4>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The standard deviation for each region:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>North: 2.99</li>
        <li>South: 2.61</li>
        <li>West: 2.16</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The West region has the most consistent monthly sales due to the lowest standard deviation.</p>
    <h2>33. How does the presence of outliers affect the mean and median of a dataset?</h2>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Outliers can greatly affect the mean because the mean considers all values in its
        calculation. An extreme outlier can pull the mean up or down, making it less representative of the central
        location of the data. The median, however, is more resistant to outliers since it depends only on the middle

        <li><strong>r = -1:</strong> Perfect negative linear relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>r = 0:</strong> No linear correlation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The closer <em>r</em> is to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship. However, a strong correlation does not

    <h4>41: Which patient group has the quickest median recovery time?</h4>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The median recovery times:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Group A: 5 days</li>
        <li>Group B: 8 days</li>
        <li>Group C: 6 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patient Group A has the quickest median recovery time of 5 days.</p>

    <h4>42: Which patient group has the least variation in recovery times?</h4>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The range of recovery times:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Group A: 3 days</li>
        <li>Group B: 2 days</li>
        <li>Group C: 2 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patient Groups B and C have the least variation in recovery times with a range of 2 days.</p>

    <h4>43: How do the interquartile ranges (IQR) of the groups compare?</h4>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The interquartile ranges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Group A: IQR = 1</li>
        <li>Group B: IQR = 2</li>
        <li>Group C: IQR = 1</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patient Groups A and C have the same IQR of 1 day, which is less than Group B's IQR.</p>

    <h2>Use Case: An E-commerce Company Analyzes Website Page Load Times</h2>
    <p>An e-commerce company analyzes its website’s page load times (in seconds) over a month to optimize user
        experience. The data includes:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Day</th>
                <th>Load Times (seconds)</th>

    <h3>44: What impact do outliers have on the average load time?</h3>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> Calculate the mean with and without outliers. Compare both means to gauge the effect of
        outliers.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong>
        With the outlier: Mean = (3 + 2.5 + 2.8 + 3.1 + 15) / 5 = 5.28<br>
        Without the outlier: Mean = (3 + 2.5 + 2.8 + 3.1) / 4 = 2.85<br>
        The outlier significantly increases the average page load time by 2.43 seconds.
    </p>

    <h3>45: How can we transform load times to normalize the data?</h3>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> Use logarithmic transformation. Compute the logarithm (base 10 or natural logarithm) of
        all page load times.</p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Log-transforming the data can help in dealing with skewed data or data with outliers. If
        the original load time was 3 seconds, the transformed value using a natural log would be ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.</p>

    <h3>46: Describe the distribution of load times using histograms.</h3>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the data into bins (e.g., 2-2.5 seconds, 2.5-3 seconds).</li>
        <li>Count the number of observations within each bin.</li>
        <li>Plot the frequency of observations vs. bins.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Using the histogram, you might find, for instance, that most page load times cluster
        around 2.5-3 seconds, indicating the mode of the distribution. Peaks would represent common load times, while
        troughs would show less frequent load times.</p>

    <h3>47: What is the Probability Density Function (PDF) for day 2's load times?</h3>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Estimate the PDF from the data (often using kernel density estimation).</li>
        <li>Plot the continuous curve, showing how densities of load times vary.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The PDF will be a continuous curve indicating the probability of the page taking a
        specific time to load. For instance, the peak around 2.7 seconds might have a higher value, indicating it's the
        most common load time for day 2.</p>

    <h3>48: What is the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for load times on day 3?</h3>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>For discrete data, compute the proportion of each unique load time.</li>
        <li>Plot these proportions.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The PMF might show, for instance, that the probability of the page taking exactly 2.7
        seconds to load is 0.2 (or 20%). It gives probabilities for discrete outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Scenario: Online Retail Store A/B Testing</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> An online retail store has introduced a new webpage design to increase the amount of
        time users spend on the page and ultimately increase purchases. They have conducted A/B testing, where Group A
        is exposed to the old design, and Group B to the new design. They've collected data on the time spent on the
        webpage and whether a purchase was made.</p>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Determine if the new webpage design leads to a significant increase in both time
        spent on the webpage and the likelihood of making a purchase.</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <h4>1. Define the Problem:</h4>
    <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H0):</strong> The new webpage design does not significantly affect the time spent on the
        webpage and the likelihood of making a purchase.</p>
    <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (HA):</strong> The new webpage design significantly affects the time spent on the
        webpage and the likelihood of making a purchase.</p>

    <h4>2. Data Collection:</h4>
    <p>Collect data on time spent on the webpage and purchasing behavior for both groups.</p>

    <h4>3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:</h4>

    <p>Conduct an Independent Samples t-test to compare the mean time spent on the webpage by the two groups.</p>

    <h4>5. Perform Chi-Square Test on Purchase Behavior:</h4>
    <p>Construct a contingency table of the groups and purchasing behavior. Then conduct a Chi-Square test to check the
        independence of the group and purchasing behavior.</p>

    <h4>6. Decision Making:</h4>
    <p>Based on the p-values from the t-test and Chi-Square test, reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. Make

if p_value < alpha:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: Group and purchase behavior are not independent.")
else:
    print("Do not reject the null hypothesis: No significant relationship between group and purchase behavior.")
    </pre>

    <h3>Decision Making:</h3>
    <p>If the p-value for the t-test on time spent is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that
        the new webpage design significantly affects the time spent on the webpage. If the p-value for the Chi-Square
        test on purchase behavior is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a
        significant relationship between the group and purchase behavior.</p>

    <h3>Business Recommendations:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>If both tests show significant results, the business should consider fully implementing the new webpage
            design.</li>
        <li>If only one test shows a significant result, further investigation is needed (e.g., improving the design to
            increase purchases).</li>
        <li>If neither test shows a significant result, the business might need to reassess the design or explore other
            changes to increase engagement and purchases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>A/B Testing Analysis - Webpage Design</h1>
    <p>This Python script performs an analysis of A/B testing results for a webpage redesign, comparing the time spent
        on the page and purchase behavior between two groups. Below is the Python code used for the analysis:</p>

    <h2>Python Code for A/B Testing Analysis:</h2>
    <pre>
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats

# Sample data creation
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'group': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'B'], 
    'time_spent': [3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2, 7],
    'purchase': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
})

# Step 4: Perform T-Test on Time Spent
group_A_time_spent = data[data['group'] == 'A']['time_spent']
group_B_time_spent = data[data['group'] == 'B']['time_spent']
t_stat, p_value_time = stats.ttest_ind(group_A_time_spent, group_B_time_spent)

# Step 5: Perform Chi-Square Test on Purchase Behavior
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data['group'], data['purchase'])
chi2_stat, p_value_purchase, _, _ = stats.chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

# Step 6: Decision Making
alpha = 0.05
if p_value_time < alpha:
    print("There is a significant difference in time spent on the webpage between the two groups.")
else:
    print("There is no significant difference in time spent on the webpage between the two groups.")

if p_value_purchase < alpha:
    print("There is a significant difference in purchasing behavior between the two groups.")
else:
    print("There is no significant difference in purchasing behavior between the two groups.")
    </pre>

    <h2>Explanation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The script compares the time spent on the webpage between two groups (A - control group, B - test group)
            using an Independent Samples t-test.</li>
        <li>A Chi-Square test is used to assess whether there is a significant difference in the purchasing behavior
            between the two groups.</li>
        <li>If the p-value from the t-test is less than 0.05, it indicates a significant difference in the time spent on
            the webpage. Similarly, if the p-value from the Chi-Square test is less than 0.05, it suggests a significant
            difference in purchasing behavior.</li>
        <li>Based on the results of the tests, the null hypothesis is either rejected or not, and conclusions are made
            about the impact of the new webpage design.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
    <p>If both tests show significant differences (i.e., the p-values are less than 0.05), the recommendation is to
        implement the new webpage design. If not, further analysis and testing may be required to improve webpage
        performance and sales.</p>
    <h1>A/B Testing Analysis - Webpage Design</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed analysis of A/B testing results for comparing an old and new webpage design. The analysis is
        based on time spent on the webpage and purchasing behavior.</p>

    <h2>Hypothetical Data:</h2>
    <h3>Group A (Old Design):</h3>
    <p><strong>Time spent (minutes):</strong> [3, 5, 4, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4]</p>
    <p><strong>Purchases:</strong> [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]</p>

    <h3>Group B (New Design):</h3>
    <p><strong>Time spent (minutes):</strong> [6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8]</p>
    <p><strong>Purchases:</strong> [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Solution with Numerical Calculation:</h2>

    <h3>1. Define the Problem:</h3>
    <p>Null Hypothesis (H0): The new webpage design does not significantly affect the time spent on the webpage or the
        likelihood of making a purchase.</p>
    <p>Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The new webpage design significantly affects the time spent on the webpage or the
        likelihood of making a purchase.</p>

    <h3>2. Data Collection:</h3>
    <p>The data has been hypothetically provided above.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:</h3>
    <p>Calculate the means and standard deviations for both groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Group A (Time Spent):</strong>
            Mean = (3 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 4) / 8 = 4.75 minutes<br>
            Standard Deviation ≈ 1.16 minutes
        </li>
        <li><strong>Group B (Time Spent):</strong>
            Mean = (6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 8 + 6 + 7 + 8) / 8 = 7 minutes<br>
            Standard Deviation ≈ 0.76 minutes
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Perform T-Test on Time Spent:</h3>
    <p>We calculate the t-statistic using the formula:</p>
    <pre>
        t = (X̄1 - X̄2) / sqrt[(s₁² / n₁) + (s₂² / n₂)]
        </pre>
    <p>Where:
        <br>X̄₁ and X̄₂ are the sample means of group A and B.<br>
        s₁ and s₂ are the sample standard deviations of group A and B.<br>
        n₁ and n₂ are the sample sizes of group A and B.
    </p>
    <p>Using the given values:</p>
    <pre>
        t = (4.75 - 7) / sqrt[(1.16² / 8) + (0.76² / 8)] ≈ -5.91
        </pre>
    <p>The degrees of freedom (df) = n₁ + n₂ - 2 = 8 + 8 - 2 = 14. Consulting the t-distribution table for df=14 and
        α=0.05 (two-tailed), the critical t-value is approximately ±2.145.</p>
    <p>Since t ≈ -5.91 < -2.145, we reject the null hypothesis for time spent.</p>

            <h3>5. Perform Chi-Square Test on Purchase Behavior:</h3>
            <p>Construct a 2x2 contingency table:</p>
            <pre>
        Purchase = 0    | Purchase = 1   | Total
        Group A    | 4          | 4           | 8
        Group B    | 1          | 7           | 8
        </pre>
            <p>Calculate the expected frequencies for each cell:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For Group A and Purchase=0: Expected frequency = (row total * column total) / grand total = (8 * 5)
                    / 16 = 2.5</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Compute the chi-square statistic using the formula:</p>
            <pre>
        χ² = Σ[(observed - expected)² / expected]
        </pre>
            <p>Using the observed and expected frequencies, we get χ² ≈ 3.6.</p>
            <p>For a 2x2 table with α=0.05, the critical value from the chi-square distribution is approximately 3.841.
            </p>
            <p>Since χ² ≈ 3.6 < 3.841, we fail to reject the null hypothesis for purchase behavior.</p>

                    <h3>6. Decision Making:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The t-test indicates a significant difference in time spent on the webpage between the two
                            designs.</li>
                        <li>The chi-square test suggests that purchase behavior isn't significantly different between
                            the groups, although it's close to the threshold.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Recommendation:</h2>
                    <p>The new webpage design seems to engage users for longer periods. While purchase behavior hasn't
                        shown a statistically significant change, it's close, and with a larger sample, it might.
                        Further A/B testing or possibly combining this new design with other strategies could be
                        beneficial for sales.</p>
